								The School’s teaching philosophy is underpinned by a strong commitment to exposing students to both the theoretical and practical aspects of learning, and our lectured teaching is complemented by teaching students in their home languages. Facilitated in smaller groups, classes are highly interactive and students are given a unique opportunity to understand in depth and put in practise the theory to which they have been exposed to in lectures. Real-world scenarios and case studies are used to stimulate optimal learning and prepare students for the exams.

						<h6 class="lead"> The Mzamomtsha Primay school was established in 2008 in driftsand city of cape town.
							The school was initially created for primary school students from grade 1 to grade 7, but due to the rapid population growth (births and migration) the school is also enrolling higher grades. 
							Students are allowed up to grade 12 - which is the metric year.  
							The rapid growth has lead to a series of problems for the Mzamomtsha Primary School. There are not enough classrooms,
							 and the is not enough sufficient staff members to match the continuous growth. The school has 700 learners and a staff of 20 teachers.</h6>
